# Java-Examples
Simple Java programming examples

Here is some more detailed information about the scripts I have written. I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code.  If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to do so.
In the scripts the comments etc are lined up correctly when they are viewed in [InteliJ-IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).This is what I use to code Every scripts.

- `StudentInfo` - Create and Diaplay n student Details.
- `Random` - Play Game(Guess the Number).
- `StackDemo` - Implementing Stack using Java.
- `MergeSort` - Implementing MergeSort algorithm and displaying the time of execution for n input.
